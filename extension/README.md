   - Click "Copy URL" to copy the capture URL
   - Check the browser console for detailed capture data

## Technical Details

### Permissions Used
- `activeTab`: Access the currently active tab
- `scripting`: Execute scripts in tabs
- `storage`: Store capture data locally
- `http://localhost:5174/*`: Access local development backend
- `https://web-to-mcp.com/*`: Access production backend

### Capture Data Structure
Each capture includes:
- **Screenshot**: PNG image data (base64 encoded)
- **HTML**: Element or page HTML structure
- **Token Count**: Accurate token count using GPT-4 tokenizer
- **Website URL**: Source URL of the captured page
- **Server Response**: Server-generated slug and metadata

### API Integration
The extension integrates with the backend API for capture storage:

**POST** `/api/captures/create/`
- **Request**: `{ website_url, token_count, html, png_screenshot }`
- **Response**: `{ slug, website_url, token_count, created_at }`

All captures are automatically uploaded to the server and stored in S3, with unique slugs generated for each capture.

#### Background Script API Handling
The extension uses the background script for all API requests to ensure proper cookie access:
- All API calls are routed through the background script
- Automatic cookie handling for session authentication
- Proper cross-origin request handling
- Centralized error handling and logging

### Environment Variables

The extension uses environment variables to configure the backend URL:

- `BACKEND_URL`: The URL of your backend API
  - Development: `http://localhost:5174`
  - Production: `https://web-to-mcp.com`
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (`development` or `production`)

### Error Monitoring with Sentry

The extension includes Sentry integration for error monitoring and performance tracking:

- **Shared Environment Setup**: Uses manual client setup to avoid global state pollution
- **Browser Extension Optimized**: Configured specifically for browser extension environments
- **Error Filtering**: Filters out development errors unless explicitly enabled
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks performance with configurable sample rates
- **Context Capture**: Captures additional context for better error debugging

**Sentry Configuration:**
- DSN: Configured via environment variables
- Environment: Automatically set based on `NODE_ENV`
- Release: Set to extension version
- Debug Mode: Enabled in development
- Sample Rate: 10% in production, 100% in development

**Error Handling:**
- Global error handlers for unhandled exceptions
- Promise rejection handlers
- React error boundaries
- Manual error capturing with context

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview built extension
npm run preview
```
